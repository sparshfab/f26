    <h1>Week 3: computer-aided design </h1>

    <h2> Software Choice And CAD sub-project </h2>
    
    <h3>Software </h3>

    <p>For me chosing the cad software for my Fab Academy was easy. I have never worked with 2D CAD,
        I had heard a lot about incscape for vector work so i have decided to use that. For the 3D CAD software
        I have decent experience with Onshape but I have decided to learn Fusion 360 because i get the benifit of
        a student account and also to chalenge myself.

    <h3>Cad Project</h3>

    <p>For Learning Fusion 360 I decided to design a Peristaltic Pump that uses a motor i salveged from an old vaccum 
       robot. It uses 5mm OD silicone tube and has 3 roller design. ALl the parts are to be 3d printable and the design is parametric
       to make the tolerence adjustment easy.
